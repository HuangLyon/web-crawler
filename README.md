# web-crawler
**main fountion**
This project uses Python with Selenium to create a web crawler for extracting all comments from a YouTube video.
First, it loads the comments section by simulating scrolling to ensure all comments are visible.
Next, it expands all hidden replies under each comment thread.
Finally, it extracts the text of each comment and counts the total number of comments retrieved.
